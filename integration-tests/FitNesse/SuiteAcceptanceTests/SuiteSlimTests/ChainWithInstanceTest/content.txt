The fixture chaining with instances allows it to store an object instance in a Slim symbol and to use the instance as the table actor for an arbitrary Slim table.
Here createTestSlimWithString(string) is a factory method that creates a new !-TestSlim-! instance, sets the given string and returns the object.

!|script             |test slim                         |
|$TEST_SLIM_INSTANCE=|create test slim with string|Uncle|
|start               |$TEST_SLIM_INSTANCE               |
|check               |get string arg              |Uncle|

We can use it for a decision table.

|$TEST_SLIM_INSTANCE|
|get string arg?    |
|Uncle              |

The !-fitnesse.slim.SlimHelperLibrary-! is a class that should be used in a library table. It contains methods to get and set the script table actor in the Slim !-StatementExecutor-!.

 * scriptTableActor() returns the current table actor
 * pushActor() gets the current table actor and pushes it onto a stack
 * popActor() pops the actor from the stack and sets it in the !-StatementExecutor-!

The pushActor() and popActor() methods can be used to have scenarios that change the current actor, but restore it at the end of the scenario.
So a scenario can behave more like a sub routine with local scope (but is not limited to it).
